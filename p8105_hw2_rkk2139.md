# Problem 1

### Dataset Dimensions

    ## [1] 1868   19

For data to be tidy, each variable should form a column, and each
observation should form a row. Based on the inconsistencies in the data,
like the routes, or the use of “Yes” and “True” interchangeably, and
redundancy of column, the data is not tidy.

### How many distinct stations are there?

    ## [1] 465

### How many stations are ADA compliant?

    ## [1] 84

### What proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance?

    ## [1] 0.3770492

# Problem 2

    ## Dimensions of Mr. Trash Wheel data: 651 14

    ## Dimensions of Professor Trash Wheel data: 118 13

    ## Dimensions of Gwynnda Trash Wheel data: 263 12

    ## Dimensions of combined Trash Wheel data: 1032 14

### Observations and Key Variables

The observations in the resulting dataset total 1032 rows, and include
the data from the three different datasets, Gwynnda, Mr. Trash Wheel,
and Professor Trash Wheel. Key variables include `weight_tons` and
`volume_cubic_yards`, which are used for measuring the amount of trash.
Additionally, the variables `cigarette_butts`, `plastic_bottles`, and
others that detail the type of trash, provide information about how much
of the total trash was comprised of which trash item.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel was 246.74.
The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022
was 18120.

# Problem 3

Some observations I made were that in the bakers data frame, there is no
episode column. The results data frame and the bakes data frame only
have the baker’s first name, and the bakers data frame has first and
last. The bakers data frame contains the most information, including
details about the bakers’s hometowns, and occupations. To clean the
data, the baker’s names had to be standardized and cleaned up so that
they could be organized and merged by the same name. For instance, Jo
Wheatley was standardized to Joanne in all places so that data wouldn’t
be missed or treated as two separate contestants’ data. Her name also
had quotes around it, which were removed.

The bakes_df and results_df were then merged using a right join based on
the series, episode, and baker_first_name columns, and then a full join
with the bakers_df to ensure that all necessary baker details, such as
baker_age, baker_occupation, and hometown, were included.

The data was merged with the bakes_df to pull in missing values for the
signature_bake and show_stopper columns, ensuring the final dataset
contained all relevant information. Duplicate rows were removed, and
entries with missing results were filtered out. The final cleaned
dataset has 710 observations. Finally, the cleaned dataset was exported
alongside a tidy viewership dataset that was created by pivoting
wide-format data into a long-format structure.

The final dataset contains information from the “Great British Bake
Off,” including data on bakers, their signature bakes, technical
results, show stoppers, and final results across multiple seasons. It
was cleaned to ensure that bakers were consistently represented. The
dataset covers all key details for each baker in Seasons 1-10, with
redundant entries and missing data removed and organized in a meaningful
way.

### Star Bakers

Most bakers who were awarded multiple star baker titles tended to reach
the final rounds. For instance, Nadiya Hussain and Candice Brown were
Star Baker many times before being ultimately crowned the winner.
However, some people that were Star Baker many times were not winners at
the end of the series, such as Steph Blackwell, or Steven Carter-Bailey,
who were Star Baker more times than the eventual winner.
