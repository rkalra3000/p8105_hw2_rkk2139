# Problem 1

### Dataset Dimensions

    ## [1] 1868   19

### For data to be tidy, each variable should form a column, and each observation should form a row. Based on the inconsistencies in the data, like the routes, or the use of “Yes” and “True” interchangeably, and redundancy of column, the data is not tidy.

### How many distinct stations are there?

    ## [1] 465

### How many stations are ADA compliant?

    ## [1] 84

### What proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance?

    ## [1] 0.3770492
